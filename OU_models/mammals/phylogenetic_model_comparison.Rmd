```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(loo)
```

In this notebook, we carry out model comparison for different models of rhythm evolution. We compare the following models:

```{r}
model.types <- c('BM_UV_nondist',
                 'BM_UV_dist',
                 'OU_UV_nondist',
                 'OU_UV_dist')
```

```{r}
loos <- readRDS('frequency_loos.RDS')
loo_model_weights(loos)
```

We see that model 4 (a distributional OU model) is the best fit to the data, with > 90% of the stacking weight.

We validate this result for models fitted only on mammals within the phylogeny:

```{r}
loos <- readRDS('frequency_loos_mammals.RDS')
loo_model_weights(loos)
```

as well as birds:

```{r}
loos <- readRDS('frequency_loos_birds.RDS')
loo_model_weights(loos)
```
